# File Naming

*Cough* I just got triggered by our differing file names. *Cough* So here's a set of rules...
- If the file contains a single class: The file should have a title that is a all lowercase, snakecase version of the class title.
- If your file doesn't have a rule, or makes sense to ignore this, ignore it.
