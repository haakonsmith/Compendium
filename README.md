# Compendium

The Compendium wants to be your templated, structured journal, but also your journal for others. Where you can jot down everything from someone's (including your own) birthday, to a psychoanalytic profile, and the best part is, you don't have to use any of the functionality. 

This project was built by programmers for programmers, so it's been designed to be extremely modular and customisable.
